# Specification Quality Checklist: Two-Page Spread on Foldable Phones

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (FR-016 and FR-017 resolved 2026-11-04)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The iOS 27 build tools appear in Assumptions as a release dependency. They are a constraint
  the owner must know about, not a design choice.
- The owner answered both clarifications: the web follows the same rule (FR-016), and a
  setting, on by default, keeps one page (FR-017). All items pass.
